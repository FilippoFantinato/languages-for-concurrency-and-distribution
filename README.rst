Languages for Concurrency and Distribution
==========================================

In this repository you can find my exam for the languages for concurrency and distribution course. The exam is split in two parts: the first one where there are two theoretical exercises to solve, and the second one where the student can do a deepening, some practical exercises or a small project.

For the first part I had to solve two theoretical exercises:

* prove that each process in the finite fragment of CCS (calculus of communicating systems) with finite sums terminates in a finite number of steps and prove also that the number of reachable states is finite. Discuss the case of infinite sums.
* show that the semantics of Hennessy-Milner's logic discussed during the lectures is well defined, that is, when we consider least and greatest fixed points, the corresponding functions are monotone on a complete lattice. Discuss whether and how negation might be included in the logic.

while for the second part I decided to deepen on actor model, both theoretically and practically, using Elixir.
